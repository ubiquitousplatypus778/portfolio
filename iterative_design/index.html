        Homeroom is a startup targeted at young people living in cities that
        lack affordable housing options by allowing them to rent a single room.
        They help investors renovate their homes and find qualified renters.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        For this assignment, we decided to design a desktop website for the
        startup. We thought that the website would make it easier for investors
        to find and connect with the startup, as well as help young people find
        a room to rent.

      <h2 class="sectiontitle">1) Sketching & Wireframing</h2>
      <p>
        We started by quickly sketching out many different versions of the
        webpage.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Sketch 1:</p>
      <div class="imagediv">
        <img class="image" src="./resources/sketches/11.jpg" />
        <img class="image" src="./resources/sketches/12.jpg" />
        <img class="image" src="./resources/sketches/13.jpg" />
      </div>
      <p>Sketch 2:</p>
      <div class="imagediv">
        <img class="image" src="./resources/sketches/21.jpg" />
        <img class="image" src="./resources/sketches/22.jpg" />
        <img class="image" src="./resources/sketches/23.jpg" />

      </div>
      <br />
      <p>
        After sketching 4 potential sites, we integrated some ideas from each
        and built a lofi prototype:

      <h2 class="sectiontitle">2) Mockups</h2>
      <p>After building the lofi prototype, we built a mockup on Figma:</p>

      <h3>Mockup Critique</h3>
      <p>
        During the mockup critique we introduced our Homeroom Concept for 1
        minute to briefly, after which our peers interacted with our prototype
        for 2 minutes. We received feedback for about 10 minutes, which came
        from the TAs, other students and our industry guest Gifford Cheung, a UX
        Researcher at Nintendo.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Feedback Summary</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          188 waterman: More info about property. Given that they are investing,
          give an option to message between renter and investor.
        </li>
        <li>What does “I’m Done” button do - more specification</li>
        <li>
          Weird from the investor end of things. One click purchasing is weird
          for such a large price. Am I forced to pay yet?
        </li>
        <li>Cut down on space in favor of information density.</li>
        <li>
          Learnability of UI is lacking. Search bar on the first page, what are
          we searching for? What am I done with? Use space to teach the user.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mobile UI on website. Makes sense that it’s clean - does this fit
          alongside use-case? More reassurances / explanatory text.
        </li>
        <li>
          Could make it a mobile UI instead that accompanies a complex website.
        </li>
        <li>Button labels are very important</li>
        <li>
          Both a back button and “X” button on some pages and they have
          different transitions. Make it consistent.
        </li>
        <li>Aligned / justified text (money decimal point) is done well.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="sectiontitle">3) User Testing</h2>
      <p>
        We conducted a remote usability test on three users with the following
        instructions:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        You will be testing an interactive mockup in Figma. Not all
        functionality for the mockup has been implemented (i.e. buttons may not
        be clickable). Homeroom is a startup targeted at young people living in
        cities that lack affordable housing options by allowing them to rent a
        single room. They also help investors renovate their homes and find
        qualified renters. We encourage you to think aloud as you perform your
        tasks!
      </p>

      <h3 class="minisectiontitle">Tasks</h3>
      <p>We designed two main tasks for the users:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Task 1: You are a renter looking for a room. Find the cheapest room
          available, add it to your cart, and check out your order.
        </li>
        <li>
          Task 2: You are a wealthy landlord interested in using Homeroom. You
          have a budget of roughly 1.2 million USD. Find the renovation plan
          with the largest square footage, and submit a proposal.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        Apart from those main tasks, we asked the users to perform four small
        sub-tasks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sub-task 1: As a renter, view your profile page.</li>
        <li>
          Sub-task 2: As a renter, check out the reviews for a listed room.
        </li>
        <li>Sub-task 3: As a renter, click open the filter option.</li>
        <li>Sub-task 4: As an investor, delete a recommended property.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h3 class="minisectiontitle">Reflection on Testers:</h3>
      <ul>
        <iframe
          width="100%"
          height="400px"
          src="./resources/testers/tester 1.mp4"
          frameborder="0"
          allowfullscreen
        ></iframe>
        <br/>
        <li>Tester 1:</li>
        We were expecting testers to directly follow the main tasks as laid out
        in the scenario, but our first tester focused heavily on the “side
        tasks,” ignoring the main instructions. Further, a bunch of problems
        were caused by them not being able to navigate the overlaying Figma and
        and UserTesting UIs. For example, one of our side tasks was to click on
        the “user profile” but they tried to click on the Figma profile page.
        <br/>
        <iframe
          width="100%"
          height="400px"
          src="./resources/testers/tester 2.mp4"
          frameborder="0"
          allowfullscreen
        ></iframe>
        <br/>
        <li>Tester 2:</li>
        It took a long time for the tester to click the "match" button. They
        first wanted to click on the hamburger menu and the filter button, both
        of which we did not mock up the functionality for. Further, it took some
        time to use the Homeroom logo as a "home" button. From this, we could
        change our interface to add in more text that guides the tester even
        more on what certain buttons do, and what they should be clicking on
        first.
        <br/>
        <iframe
          width="100%"
          height="400px"
          src="./resources/testers/tester 3.mp4"
          frameborder="0"
          allowfullscreen
        ></iframe>
        <br/>
        <li>Tester 3:</li>
        Similarly to the second tester, the third one had trouble figuring out
        the functionality of different buttons. They also learned to use the
        HomeRoom icon as a "home button". While both users were eventually able
        to figure this out, the time it took them to do so suggests that we
        could make this even more learnable in a further iteration.
